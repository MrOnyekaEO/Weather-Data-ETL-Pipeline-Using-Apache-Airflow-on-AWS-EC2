# Weather-Data-ETL-Pipeline-Using-Apache-Airflow-on-AWS-EC2
Building and automating a Python ETL pipeline using VS Code for an OpenWeather API, transferring data to an AWS S3 data lake, and orchestrating the process with Apache Airflow running on AWS EC2.

### Project Overview
This project aims to create a robust and efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API and store it in an AWS S3 data lake. The pipeline will be built using Python in Visual Studio Code and orchestrated using Apache Airflow running on an AWS EC2 instance.

### Project Objectives
- Extract weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- Transform the extracted data into a suitable format for storage in S3.
- Load the transformed data into an S3 bucket.
- Automate the ETL process using Apache Airflow.
- Ensure data quality and consistency throughout the pipeline.

**Components:**
- **OpenWeather API:** The source of weather data.
- **Python (VS Code):** The programming language used to build the ETL pipeline.
- **AWS S3:** The data lake for storing the extracted and transformed data.
- **Apache Airflow:** The orchestration tool for scheduling and monitoring the pipeline.
- **AWS EC2:** The virtual machine hosting Apache Airflow.

### ETL Pipeline Steps

1. **Extraction:**
   - Fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API using the `requests` library.
   - Handle API rate limits and potential errors.

2. **Transformation:**
   - Clean and preprocess the extracted data.
   - Convert data to a suitable format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
   - Add necessary metadata or derived fields.

3. **Loading:**
   - Upload the transformed data to an S3 bucket using the `boto3` library.
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms.

### Automation with Apache Airflow
- Create an Apache Airflow DAG to define the ETL pipeline's workflow.
- Schedule the DAG to run at desired intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
- Use Airflow operators to represent each step of the pipeline.
- Monitor the DAG's execution status and handle failures.

### Data Quality
- Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity.
- Monitor data quality metrics and alert on anomalies.
- Consider using data profiling tools for in-depth analysis.

### Deployment and Maintenance
- Deploy the ETL pipeline to the AWS EC2 instance.
- Configure Apache Airflow and necessary environment variables.
- Regularly monitor and maintain the pipeline for optimal performance.

### Potential Enhancements
- Explore advanced data transformation techniques (e.g., feature engineering, data normalization).
- Integrate with other data sources or systems.
- Implement data security measures (e.g., encryption, access controls).
- Consider using serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda) for scalability.

### Conclusion
This project provides a solid foundation for building an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load weather data into an AWS S3 data lake. By following the outlined steps and considering the potential enhancements, you can create a reliable and efficient data engineering solution.
